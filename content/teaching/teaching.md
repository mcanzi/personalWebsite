Hi

In the summer term of 2021 (Apil-July), I'm teaching a __Statistics__ course for MA students in Multilingualism at Universit√§t Konstanz. The course is taught online. You can find all of the video lecture material on Vimeo [here](https://vimeo.com/mcanzi)

If you are interested in tutorial and exercise material for the course (or extra resources), please do not hesitate to get in touch with me via e-mail

Thanks

Max
