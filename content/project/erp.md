## Abstract

Evidence from event-related potential (ERP) research indicates that phonological and semantic incongruities in online language processing and perception are solved indipendently during language processing (D’Arcy et al. 2004). In particular, the N400 component is greater when semantic mismatch is present in language pocessing and comprehension tasks (Kutas and Hillyard 1980; Kutas and Hillyard 1984). The Phonological Mismatch (or Mapping) Negativity (PMN) component, on the other hand, is commonly observed whenever phonological mismatch is present during (spoken-)word recognition (e.g. Van Den Brink et al. 2001; Connolly and Phillips 1994; Connolly et al. 1992; etc). While the N400 peaks at around 400 ms post stimulus-onset, the PMN is often observed earlier, peaking at around 250-300 ms (e.g. D’Arcy et al. 2004; Connolly and Phillips 1994). This order of processing information could suggest a feed-forward model and grammar of perception and processing of language (e.g. McQueen et al. 2009). Although it has been argued that the N400 and PMN components are representative of the same type of processing, both relating to some sort of lexical or semantic incongruity in language processing (Diaz and Swaab 2007; Jacquier et al. 2005), evidence has also been provided to support the opposite hypothesis (e.g. Connolly and Phillips 1994; D’Arcy et al. 2004). However, literature on the PMN is scarce and findings, especially related to the topography of the ERP component, are not consistent among studies (Lewendon et al. 2020).

D’arcy (2004) conducted a visual-auditory sentence-matching ERP experiment to investigate the spatial distribution of PMN and N400 responses. Participants were presented with a visual-auditory stimulus pair (e.g. visual: ”A teacher in the classroom”, auditory: ”The teacher is in the school / barn”). The final word of each sentence was changed throughout the experiment in order to alter the level of semantic congruity. Category-exemplar probability was also accounted for when choosing sentence-final stimuli. While levels of semantic congruity would elicit different amplitudes of the N400 component, low-predictability words have been hypothesised to affect PMN amplitude (D’Arcy et al. 2004). Congruent, predictable stimuli found to elicit neither component. Congruent but unpredictable stimuli elicited a small PMN component, but no N400. It appears that the two components can be in fact separated and attributed to different levels of processing in language comprehension and perception. One limitation of D’arcy’s (2004) and similar (e.g. Connolly and Phillis 1994; Kujala 2004) studies is that, although PMN and N400 seem to reflect two separate aspects of on-line language processing, namely phonological and lexical elaboration respectively, the PMN component is usually elicited by highly unpredictable words, where predictability is determined by semantic and syntactic contexts. This finding does not necessarily suggest that the PMN component is related to unpredictable phonological features in speech, but its observation could derive from the influence of any level of processing involved in the study, including phonological, semantic and syntactic in cloze-probability tasks. 

Isolating a single aspect of language comprehension and processing (e.g. phonological mapping) is not always achievable in combination with an ERP experimental paradigm and, in many cases, single ERP components have been found to be linked to multiple aspects of speech and language processing simultaneously. For instance, the P600 component, known to be elicited by syntactic integration in language comprehension (Kaan et al. 2000), was also found to be elicited by semantic mismatch, similarly to the aforementioned N400 component (e.g. Van Herten et al. 2005). Although many experiments have managed to separate N400 and PMN in speech perception and processing ERP paradigms, mismatch in phonological predictability has often been caused by semantic or syntactic contexts (e.g. D’Arcy et al. 2004; Connolly and Phillips 1994; Kujala et al. 2004) rather than by specifically phonological mismatch alone.

The current study aims at investigating the presence of the PMN component (and other pre-lexical components) in a context where the predictability of speech sounds is determined by the experimental paradigm alone, rather than by existing semantic and syntactic influences. This process is done through a learning paradigm, where participants are prompted to learn a sequence of nonce words, grouped in pairs, where the transitional probability between the two items of the pair is 1. The word-initial syllable of the second item of each pair is manipulated (33% of trials) to create mismatch. If it is the case that the PMN is greater when phonological mismatch alone is present (Connolly and Phillips 1994), the current experimental paradigm should be able to capture the PMN's elicitation, avoiding, at the same, any external influence by semantic or syntactic contexts.
However, the non-elicitation of the PMN in a context where phonological mismatch is present without any semantic mapping would suggest that the PMN reflects a higher-level of phonological mapping, specifically a level of phonological mismatch that is directly mediated by lexical activation and retrieval.
