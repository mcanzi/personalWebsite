The aim of our study is to determine whether phonological information is pro- cessed earlier than semantic information in a feed-forward fashion during perception (McQueen et al. 2009) or whether di􏰁erent levels of speech (e.g. phonological, semantic) can mediate one another during perception and processing (McClelland & Elman 1986). In order to achieve this, we plan to investigate the nature of early event-related potentials (ERP), shifts in electrical poten- tial in the brain as a response to a particular event, to determine whether phonological and lexical features of speech are processed by the brain at di􏰁erent times. the N400 component (Kutas & Hillyard 1980) is a negative shift in electrical potential found approximately 400 ms post stimu- lus onset where the stimulus is semantically incompatible with the context in which it is found. Similarly, the phonological mismatch negativity (PMN) component (Groppe et al. 2010) is found 200-250 ms post stimulus onset, with the stimulus being a phonologically unexpected sequence in its context (e.g. a word which begins with a phonotactically illegal syllable). This advances the idea that phonological features of speech are processed earlier in time by the brain compared to semantic features (McQueen et al. 2009). However, others argue that there is little di􏰁erence between N400 and pre-N400 components (Diaz & Swaab 2007) and that these components are also not speci􏰀c to language processing (Dikker & Pylkkanen 2011). Understanding the level of independence between N400 and pre-N400 components, together with an exploratory analysis on the language-speci􏰀c nature of these components, will allow us to determine what information is processed during speech perception and when.

The aim of the first experiment is to explore what pre-N400 e􏰁ects are found in a context where an unexpected speech sequence is perceived but no lexical activation or retrieval is present. Participants are instructed to learn two pairs of trisyllabic nonce words (e.g. piputu bibapu, tapabi dipida) where the transitional probability between the 􏰀rst and the second item of each pair is 1. EEG data is later recorded and the pairs of nonce words are played back to the participants of the study. However, in some cases, the 􏰀rst syllable of the second nonce word of each pair is manipulated to be di􏰁erent. Hearing unexpected phonemes should elicit pre-N400 components, which are thought to be unrelated to lexical retrieval (Groppe et al. 2010). Future experiments will employ similar methods but di􏰁erent stimuli, such as real words (lexically activated) and sine- wave tones (non-speech sounds) to determine which of these components are speci􏰀c to linguistic processing, if any.

After collecting data from 21 participants and processing the EEG signal in Matlab. I imported my ERP data in R and tried some graphical exploration of the results.
