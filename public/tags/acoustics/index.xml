Abstract This study examines how proficient second language speakers of Belfast English and Northern Standard German realize cross-linguistic differences in intonational phonological categories and their gradient phonetic implementation. Belfast English and Northern Standard German select two different intonation patterns for nuclear pitch accents in declarative utterances. Northern Standard German features a falling pitch accent pattern. In Belfast English, a rising intonation contour is realised.
The experiment compared the production of phonologically different pitch accents in declarative utterances and gradient acoustic characteristics of pitch range in utterancefinal position and peak alignment in nuclear pitch accents produced by native Belfast English learners of Northern Standard German with that of native Northern Standard German learners of Belfast English.</description>

 Abstract Background. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made a daily use of face masks mandatory. This has greatly influenced the everyday communication since face masks interfere with both acoustic and visual cues that would otherwise be available to interlocutors in spoken interaction. The present study focuses on the effect of this interference for the perception of 4 voiceless English fricatives: dental /θ/, labiodental /f/, alveolar /s/, and postalveolar /ʃ/.</description>
