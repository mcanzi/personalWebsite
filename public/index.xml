      <description>Overview Aims and Objectives
• To explore how different levels of speech processing interact with each other to facilitate the understanding of speech.
• To test experimentally the relative timing of different levels in speech processing.
• To collect EEG (electroencephalography) data from a relevant sample size on brain re- sponses to auditory stimuli.
Background: Two main currents of thought in psycholinguistics have categorised speech per- ception to be either unidirectional or interactive.</description>

Abstract Introduction. Lexical frequency is known to modulate the effects of a phonetic bias on speech production, such that high-frequency words show a stronger effect for a particular bias since they are exposed more often to that bias (Bybee 2004).</description>
