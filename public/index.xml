Abstract This study examines how proficient second language speakers of Belfast English and Northern Standard German realize cross-linguistic differences in intonational phonological categories and their gradient phonetic implementation. Belfast English and Northern Standard German select two different intonation patterns for nuclear pitch accents in declarative utterances. Northern Standard German features a falling pitch accent pattern. In Belfast English, a rising intonation contour is realised.
The experiment compared the production of phonologically different pitch accents in declarative utterances and gradient acoustic characteristics of pitch range in utterancefinal position and peak alignment in nuclear pitch accents produced by native Belfast English learners of Northern Standard German with that of native Northern Standard German learners of Belfast English.</description>

 Abstract Background. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made a daily use of face masks mandatory. This has greatly influenced the everyday communication since face masks interfere with both acoustic and visual cues that would otherwise be available to interlocutors in spoken interaction. The present study focuses on the effect of this interference for the perception of 4 voiceless English fricatives: dental /θ/, labiodental /f/, alveolar /s/, and postalveolar /ʃ/.</description>

      <description>Presentations Coretta, S. &amp;amp; Canzi, M. The effect of lexical frequency on vowel phonation as a correlate of /t/-	glottaling. Talk presented at the Linguistic Association of Great Britain (LAGB) conference at the University of Sheffield.
Abstract Introduction. Lexical frequency is known to modulate the effects of a phonetic bias on speech production, such that high-frequency words show a stronger effect for a particular bias since they are exposed more often to that bias (Bybee 2004).</description>

      <description>Hi
In the summer term of 2021 (Apil-July), I&amp;rsquo;m teaching a Statistics course for MA students in Multilingualism at Universität Konstanz. The course is taught online. You can find all of the video lecture material on Vimeo here
If you are interested in tutorial and exercise material for the course (or extra resources), please do not hesitate to get in touch with me via e-mail
Thanks
