      <description>The aim of our study is to determine whether phonological information is pro- cessed earlier than semantic information in a feed-forward fashion during perception (McQueen et al. 2009) or whether di􏰁erent levels of speech (e.g. phonological, semantic) can mediate one another during perception and processing (McClelland &amp;amp; Elman 1986). In order to achieve this, we plan to investigate the nature of early event-related potentials (ERP), shifts in electrical poten- tial in the brain as a response to a particular event, to determine whether phonological and lexical features of speech are processed by the brain at di􏰁erent times.</description>

LAGB 2018
Abstract Introduction. Lexical frequency is known to modulate the effects of a phonetic bias on speech production, such that high-frequency words show a stronger effect for a particular bias since they are exposed more often to that bias (Bybee 2004).</description>
